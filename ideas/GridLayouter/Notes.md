# General Description
Cusom Widget with Label, Line-Edit and PushButton in horizontal layout.
More than one of these cusom widgets in a vertical layout with different label length.
Layout seems to be cluttered.
Solution: GridLayouter which parses through the widgets column by column and sets the width to the maximum of all.
