# Ideas
* current problem: RCC step only performed if qrc file changed - would be great if qrc would be invoked if one of the linked files changed
* Converter: D:\CMake\DevTools\OwnTools\src\CodeCreator\Resources\Templates\ExperimentElement\ExperimentElementTemplateGui\ExperimentElementTemplatePanel.ui -> <file>Templates/ExperimentElement/ExperimentElementTemplateGui/ExperimentElementTemplatePanel.ui</file>
* create console application which can be called from visual studio (long-time goal: remove CMAKE_AUTOMOC etc. from CMake files since the CMake mechanisms seems to be unreliable)
* plain text field with output of results
* generate md5 file (analogue to CodeCleaner) so only changed files are passed to ui/moc compiler
* also run moc
